* By adopting resuable components, it flattens the learning curve.
* Being capable of modeling deal via a natureal & structural language way.

    - investment analytics 
  
      - setting pool/loan level assumptions: default, prepayment, loss, (revolving assupmtions)
      - setting deal level assumptions: trigger, call, interest rate curve
      - view the projected pool and bond cashflow , pricing the cashflow to get IRR / WAL / Duration and PV
    - or structuring ( pool selection/waterfall design/bond pricing) by 
  
      - swapping different pool/liability plans 
      - to view the projected pool and bond cashflow from these plans 
      - pick the best plan  
    - using ``RESTful`` service, easy to integration (Docker is ready)
